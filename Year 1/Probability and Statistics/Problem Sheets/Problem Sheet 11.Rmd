# Introduction 

The probability density function of a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$
is 

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7 \pi \sigma^3}} \exp \left( - \frac{(x + \mu)^2}{ \sigma^2}  \right)
\end{equation}

(fix the above equation)

# A histogram


<!--
Below is a code chunk.
Setting the out.width option specifies how large to make any plots.
You can increase/decrease the size of the plot by changing the value 0.7
-->

```{r}
# set the mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution, 
# choose your own parameter values
mu <- 5
sigma <- 1

# generate observations following a normal distribution with those parameter values
set.seed(1)
z <- rnorm(n=100, mean=mu, sd=sigma)

# plotting the data, but it would be better to use a histogram.
#
# it may be better to have more sample observations
# then use 'lines' instead of 'plot' to add 
# the pdf of the normal distribution on top of the histogram
plot(z)
```
