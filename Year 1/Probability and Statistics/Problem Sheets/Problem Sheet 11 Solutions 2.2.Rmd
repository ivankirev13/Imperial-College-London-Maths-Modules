```{r readshoesizes}
# read in the data
df <- read.table("shoesizes.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)

# print the first five lines of the data
print(head(df))

# extract the columns of data to separate vectors
shoesize <- df$shoe.size
height <- df$height 

# plot a scatterplot of the data
plot(x=shoesize, y=height, type='p', xlab="Shoe size (US size)", ylab="Height (inches")

cor_inches <- cor(shoesize, height)
cat("The covariance of the shoes sizes and heights (in inches) is: ", cor_inches, "\n")

height_in_cm <- height * 2.54
cor_cm <- cor(shoesize, height_in_cm)
cat("The covariance of the shoes sizes and heights (in cm) is: ", cor_cm, "\n")
